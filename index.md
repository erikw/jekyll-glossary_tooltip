# What?
This is a live demo of [erikw/jekyll-glossary_tooltip](https://github.com/erikw/jekyll-glossary_tooltip).

# Examples
Check out the source code ([`index.md`](https://github.com/erikw/jekyll-glossary_tooltip/blob/gh-pages-source/index.md?plain=1#L11-L16), [`glossary.yml`](https://github.com/erikw/jekyll-glossary_tooltip/blob/gh-pages-source/_data/glossary.yml)) of this page to see what syntax was used to produce the output below:

* Testing a simple glossary tag {% glossary plugin %} here.
* A bit longer explanation of the term  {% glossary SSG %}.
* This possible to have an {% glossary URL %} as well in the bottom.
  * I can decide to style the term {% glossary url %} with a different case.
  * Or even with a different text all together: {% glossary URL, display: URLocator %}
* Open this page in your mobile / touch device: it works as well to tap on term to open the definition!
* You can also create a page listing [all glossary terms](glossary.html).
